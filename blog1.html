                    <h1> History fo Telangana</h1>
                    <h2>Culture</h2>
                    <p>South of North and North of South, 'Telangana State has long been a meeting place for diverse languages and cultures. 
                        It is easily the best example for India's composite culture, pluralism and inclusiveness.
                        Located on the uplands of Deccan plateau, Telangana is the link between the North and South of India. 
                        It is thus no surprise that the region on the whole came to be known for its Ganga-Jamuna Tehzeeb and the capital Hyderabad as a 'miniature India!''.</p>
                    <p>Geography, Polity and Economy of the region determined the culture of Telangana. 
                        Satavahanas, the earliest known rulers of the region sowed the seeds of independent and self-sufficient village economy, the relics of which can be felt even today. 
                        In the medieval times, the Kakatiya dynasty's rule, between the 11th and 14th centuries with Warangal as their capital, and subsequently the Qutub Shahis and Asafjahis, who ruled the Hyderabad state defined the culture of the region. </p>
                    <h2>Arts forms  </h2>
                    <li>Some classical art forms received the royal patronage and attained finesse. However, the art forms of the innumerable communities spread across the length and breadth of the State give Telangana its distinct identity. </li>
                    <li>While the Kakatiya rule led to evolution of dance forms such as Perini Sivatandavam,  also known as ‘dance of warriors’, the commoners, faced with the challenges of daily life developed traditions of story-telling coupled with solutions to tide over them through Golla Suddulu, Oggu Kathalu and Gotralu etc.
